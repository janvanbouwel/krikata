# Example: Hello World

We step through the process of defining, parsing and executing a language using a trivial Hello World program. The program consists of two functions: `hello` and `hi`, of which the former takes a string as argument. When executed, the program greets the provided argument. For example:

```
> hello world
"<!-- cmdrun node src/cli.js hello world -->"
> hello moon
"<!-- cmdrun node src/cli.js hello moon -->"
> hi
"<!-- cmdrun node src/cli.js hi -->"
```
