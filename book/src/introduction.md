# Introduction

Krikata is an experimental framework to quickly build a parser and interpreter for Domain Specific Languages. It evaluates left to right, is right associative, and strongly typed, with an expression's type being fully dependent on the context in which it is evaluated. Krikata is primarily intended for running commands, and its execution is inherently asynchronous.

This book is split into two parts: A tutorial where two example languages are gradually built up and made more complex to introduce different parts of Krikata, and a [Reference](./ref/reference.md) that can be read in any order.
